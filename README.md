🧩 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering


📘 Project Overview
  This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm — one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques.
  The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior, which helps businesses understand their customer base and develop                    targeted marketing strategies.

🧠 Objective :- To segment customers into meaningful groups based on:
  -> Annual Income
  -> Spending Score
    

⚙️ Steps Involved

  Importing Dependencies :- Loaded necessary Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
  Data Collection & Exploration :- Loaded the dataset (typically “Mall_Customers.csv”) and analyzed the structure, missing values, and key statistical insights.
  Feature Selection :- Selected the Annual Income and Spending Score columns as the main features for clustering.
  Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters:-Used the Elbow Method to compute WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) and determine the optimal cluster count — which turned          out to    be 5.
  Model Training :- Applied the K-Means algorithm to the selected features and trained the model to classify customers into 5 clusters.
  Visualization :- Created clear scatter plots showing how customers are grouped, with each color representing a different cluster.


📊 Results

-> The model successfully divided customers into 5 distinct groups:
-> High-income, high-spending customers
-> High-income, low-spending customers
-> Average-income, average-spending customers
-> Low-income, high-spending customers
-> Low-income, low-spending customers
